Cube Fusion was part of a student exposition at the <a href="">Universeum<a>, Gothenburg, Sweden.

It is a 2-player game that is designed to teach children the basic idea of programming:
- Find a problem
- Input a solution
- Test the solution
- Repeat

Cube Fusion looks like every other puzzle game. But there is a catch. when the players see the level, they can not directly control their characters. 
They must enter the moves they want their character to make in advance and then wait and see whether their plans work out. Not only do the players have to plan ahead, but they 
must also anticipate which moves their teammate take, in order to finally unite on the goal tile.

# How it was made

We were a team of 5 programmers (no designers, as evident), who studied game design and software engineering. The project runs on a server, which two tablets are connected to via
IP. The tablets run the <a href="https://github.com/JamesTheButler/Cube-Fusion-Client">client application<a> and serve then as input devices for the player characters.
